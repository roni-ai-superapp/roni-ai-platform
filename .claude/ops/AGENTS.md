# Agent Registry

This registry prevents overlap when multiple agents work in parallel.

**Update this file:**
- At the start of work
- When handing off
- When going idle

**Issues #6, #7, #8 Complete:**
- ✅ DDL tables (payers, clients, reps, sales_report_entries) + sales_report_view
- ✅ Prisma schema with PageConfig, ToolExecution, AuditLog, ViewWhitelist
- ✅ Migrations applied to Railway Postgres (Postgres-OG9n)
- ✅ Seed script run (PageConfig, ViewWhitelist, test dimension data)
- ✅ API endpoints return data from DB with BigInt/Decimal/Date serialization
- ✅ Frontend displays live data from Postgres
- ✅ CORS configured for frontend domain
- ✅ DATABASE_OPS.md with Railway CLI limitations documented
- ✅ Verification screenshots posted inline to both issues
- ✅ ToolExecutor implemented with data.insert_row support
- ✅ Tool Gateway integration for data mutation tools
- ✅ Data tool schemas added to shared-contracts
- ✅ Railway deployment verified (SHA: feface4)

**Issue #10 M2 Verification Complete:**
- ✅ M2.1 DDL Generator - Complete
- ✅ M2.2 Platform API DB - Complete
- ✅ M2.3 Agent Runtime - Complete (#15 schema mismatch fixed)
- ✅ M2.4 Integration Test - Tests created and enabled, pending DB connection

**Issue #12 Complete (Railway-safe CI):**
- Added `scripts/check-deps.mjs` to services/plaid, plaid-frontend, accounting-db
- Added `check:deps` and `precommit` scripts to package.json files
- Updated CI workflows to run Railway-safe validation on PRs
- Added check-deps to packages/data-ingestion for future use
- Documented workspace:* issue in data-ingestion that needs fixing before Railway deploy
- All health endpoints verified working (platform-api, frontend)

**Issue #14 Complete (Display Bug Fix):**
- Root cause: Column definitions used dot notation (`payer.name`) but DB view returns `payer_name`
- Fixed `packages/platform-api/src/app_config/fixtures.ts` - changed field mappings
- Fixed `packages/shared-contracts/fixtures/pageconfig/client1_sales_report_page.json`
- TypeScript typecheck and lint pass

**Issue #9 Progress (Integration Test):**
- Created `packages/platform-api/tests/integration/m2-vertical-slice.test.ts` (400+ lines)
- Created `packages/platform-api/vitest.config.ts`
- Tests cover: preview/confirm flow, idempotency, audit log, whitelist enforcement
- Blocked by #15 (schema mismatch) - tests document expected behavior
